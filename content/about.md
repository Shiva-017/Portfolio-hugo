# Hi there! I'm Shiva Teja Dasi, a Software Engineer and MS Student at Northeastern University üëã

I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University, Boston, MA, where I have achieved a GPA of 3.62. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in various software engineering principles and practices.

## My Passion for Technology üíª

From a young age, I've been captivated by the ability of technology to solve complex problems and enhance the quality of life. This passion has driven me to continuously learn and innovate in the field of software engineering, working on projects that have a meaningful impact.

## My Professional Experience üöÄ

Throughout my career, I have gained valuable experience in software development through various roles:

1. **Software Engineer at Cimpress, Mumbai, India**: I contributed to the Dexters Team for PixartPrinting, developing 30+ customizable ReactJS/TypeScript features in a microservices architecture. I implemented Test Driven Development with Jest and React, achieving over 95% code coverage, and integrated Open AI DALL-E for custom image generation.

2. **Software Developer at The 10x Academy Startup, Hyderabad, India**: I executed a migration from React to Next.js and Node.js to Golang, managing over 2000 users with a 1.6s load time. I addressed backend performance issues, automated CI/CD pipelines with Kubernetes, and engineered a CMS with ReactJS and Express JS, reducing costs by 20%.

## My Skills and Interests üß†

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++

- **Database Technologies**: MySQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, GORM, Postgres, NoSQL, SQL
- **Software Tools & Practices**: Postman, Figma, Visual Studio, UI/UX, JIRA, Agile, Linux, TDD

When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and staying active with outdoor activities.

## My Academic Projects üìö

1. **Cloud Infrastructure Project | GCP, Terraform, Packer**: Architected secure Google Cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Packer, with GitHub Actions for CI. Integrated automated unit tests with Jest, ensured DB/API health during PRs, and implemented rolling updates for scalable instances.

2. **Blink Step | Java, JavaFX, OpenStreetMap**: Developed a location-based app employing Graphs and Linked Lists, integrating Dijkstra's and A* algorithms for optimal routing in Boston.

3. **Panorama Ed | React, Express, MongoDB, NodeJS, Redux, PWA**: Built a full stack web application for students, enabling college comparison and user feed, with WebSocket for mentor chat and analytical NLP sentiment analysis for service feedback.
